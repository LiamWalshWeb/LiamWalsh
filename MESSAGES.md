I hope everyone's having a good start to the week, I hope everyone is well üëç

I post here asking for support. I'm currently training to tackle the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge with some friends. If you know the National Three Peaks it's like an easier version of that üòÖ

We're fundraising for Southmead Hospital's Maternity Bereavement Service who specialise supporting families experiencing the loss of a baby/babies.

Why this service in particular? They provided immensely great support to my best friend and his wife when the sadly lost triplets. It was a very, very difficult time for them. My friend is like another brother to me, he's a brave, smart, hardworking, amazing person. He dealt with a situation I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

I suggested this fundraiser to them after they invited me to join the Three Peaks challenge to extend the support and appreciation for what they're going through. They accepted and here we are.

Most of us will have lost a loved one in ours lives at some point, please consider supporting me and my friends in providing aid to a service that is crucially needed.

If you feel this a cause worth supporting you can find more of an explanation on [my page](https://liamwalsh.co.uk/) or go directly to the [donation page](https://southmeadhospitalcharity.enthuse.com/pf/jasper-ivy-astrid), thank you üôè
