	          Hi, my name is Liam Walsh! I'm a web designer, web developer, web enthusiast! I create websites from start to finish with all the trimmings. I also create what I call <a href="/humble-tributes">Humble Tributes</a> which are one page web designs inspired by things I love.
</p>
<p>
	          I love to design my websites mobile first with designs focused around content, keeping designs clean and clear for usability.
</p>
<p>
	          I'm from Manchester in England and currently work for <a href="//www.accessadvertising.co.uk/">Access Advertising</a> as a front end web developer.
