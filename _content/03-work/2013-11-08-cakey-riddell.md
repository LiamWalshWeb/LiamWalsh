	Katie Riddell is a Manchester based cake decorator who specialises in celebration cakes. After attending a cake decoration class in high school, she took a keen interest in the art and began making cakes for friends and family. In September 2012, Katie was a finalist in The Cake and Bake Show’s ‘Edible Beach Cake Competition’ at Earls Court in London, and over the past year has trained as a pastry chef at Trafford College. In addition to her training, Katie has been attending courses taught by industry professionals such as Carlos Lischetti to improve her skills.

	June 2013 saw another exciting project with Katie making a cake for Apocalypse’s Steven Brosnan. This offered her a change to try making less dainty figures, and to try making zombies! The cake was complimented by both Steven and Derren Brown on twitter, Derren tweeting “WOW!” in reference to the cake, posting it to his 1.6 million followers and similarly, Steven praised Katie as “very talented” through his twitter, calling the cake “stunning”!
