  	          I see nothing in your eyes, and the more I see the less I like. <br>
  	          Is it over yet, in my head? <br>
  	          I know nothing of your kind, and I won't reveal your evil mind. <br>
  	          Is it over yet? I can't win.
  </p>
  <p class="lyrics-chorus-one">
  	          So sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left. <br>
  	          I know that I can find the fire in your eyes. <br>
  	          I'm going all the way, get away, please.
  </p>
  <p class="lyrics-chorus-two">
  	          You take the breath right out of me. <br>
  	          You left a hole where my heart should be. <br>
  	          You got to fight just to make it through, <br>
  	          'cause I will be the death of you.
  </p>
  <p class="lyrics-verse-two">
  	          This will be all over soon. <br>
  	          Pour salt into the open wound. <br>
  	          Is it over yet? Let me in.
