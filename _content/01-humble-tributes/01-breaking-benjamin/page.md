	   Music can be a powerful influence in people, there is music out there for every emotion a person can experience and <a href="http://www.shallowbay.com/" target="_blank">Breaking Benjamin</a> certainly do that! I first stumbled across these guys when I was in my college years, going through times both good and bad. The first song I ever heard was Breath (I first heard it <a href="http://youtu.be/qQ3qJmgktS0" target="_blank">here</a>, it's also my all time favourite song!) from the third album Phobia.
</p>
<p>
	   Phobia has been chosen as both the first humble tribute to Breaking Benjamin and also the first humble tribute ever!
</p>
<p>
	   I dedicate these tributes to <strong>Breaking Benjamin</strong>, they have filled my soul with their sound and in listening pushes me to the edge of myself.
