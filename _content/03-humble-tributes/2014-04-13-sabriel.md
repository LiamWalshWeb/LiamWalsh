<p>
	 The first of a trilogy of books that I have loved from my early teenage years, written by Garth Nix, this tribute is inspired by the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sabriel-Garth-Nix/dp/0007137311/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398275423&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sabriel">beautiful cover</a> for the book (the british version). The books really struck a cord with me through it's unique and colourful world, interesting characters and original ideas in the fantasy landscape.
</p>
<p>
	 One of the most iconic and original ideas from the book is the idea of Charter magic, the idea of magical spells being conjured through different forms whether it be written, spoken or whistled are just a few ways. In the books The Charter describes everything in the world much like the periodic table in real life.
</p>
<p>
	 I wanted to be able to portray what some of those charter marks might look like taking leads from the covers from the books and also through reading. Having the book covers main charter mark at centre stage and being able to almost feel the power of that one charter mark through interaction.
