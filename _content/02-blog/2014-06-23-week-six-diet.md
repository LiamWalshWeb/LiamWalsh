<p>With a long week of very strength intensive and long workouts ahead, this week I have put more effort and research into getting my diet right. With a regime as tough as Freeletics that has big fat burners such as burpees and jumping jacks it's important to get your diet right.</p><p>I found this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acaloriecounter.com/diet/">helpful guide online</a> that details a lot of the very common sense stuff about dieting along with some other great information that you may not know.</p><p>I highly suggest reading this if you are serious about losing weight or putting on some muscle mass. There are three main categories of diet for people and the category I fall under is 'Lose and Reduce'. Basically I want to lose some weight and trim the extra fat before putting on a lot of muscle mass so I fall under that category and summed up really simply I want to burn more calories then I consume. It's not as simple as eating less, or eating smaller meals more often or a lot of other things you might here, this guide puts the emphasise on what you eat.</p><p>I have learned from reading this guide the types of food that I need to be eating in order to maintain a protein rich, low carb diet. Admittedly this week I've turned into a bit of a calorie obsessed nut case, I read the labels on all the food I eat and also plan my meals for the day to see what calorie intake I'll be eating and also know if I'm getting enough protein.</p><p>To track all of this and to get a better idea of not just how much I'm putting in but burning off I bought a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fitbit.com/uk/flex">Fitbit Flex</a>!</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/fitbit-flex.jpg"></p><p>I've had the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fitbit.com/uk/flex">Fitbit Flex</a> for a week now and has been very useful in setting and tracking daily goals.&nbsp;The Fitbit flex also comes with an online service in which you can track everything in your fitness life including number of steps taken, distance covered, weight, sleep, calories in and out.&nbsp;The online dashboard is particularly useful for seeing progress on a daily basis.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/Fitbit Dashboard.png"></p><p>I'd highly recommend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fitbit.com/uk/flex" style="background-color: initial;">Fitbit Flex</a> to compliment keeping track of your diet along with tracking the calories burned with Freeletics!
