	With last weeks near slip up I wanted to hit the ground running! I wanted this week to be more positive and more challenging then all the previous weeks combined! I set my expectations better this time, I accepted that achieving personal bests each time might not always happen, but I will do everything to reach them! The biggest challenge this week was dealing with the weather. Living in the UK is great&nbsp;and I love this country, but the weather here can drive people mad.</p><p>I faced Monday's workout when I got home from work at around 6pm, having been a decent day all around I prepare to take on a workout I've not done before, Iris. I knew this one was gonna be a tough one for the number of rounds and the type of exercises involved. I look outside to my back garden and see... <strong>rain!</strong> Not really that gentle either. I knew I had to go out and face it though, it was miserable and I felt my performance slipping with each round, but making it through that I actually enjoyed the feeling of finishing such a difficult workout. In that moment, whilst stripping off my sweat and rain drenched clothes, I realised something about Freeletics that it pretty well summed up by this picture seen below.</p><p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/t31.0-8/1658566_827106853969817_236878925_o.jpg"></p><p><em>"Freeletics doesn't get easier, you just get better"</em> that pretty much sums it up. Facing Aphrodite on the Wednesday proved that quote with a massive personal best smash by about nine minutes! I had gotten better, in such a short space of time I had achieved something that I thought would take me forever to reach. It rained on that day as well but it didn't stop me reaching a new best.</p><p>I wanted to highlight another amazing Freeletics transformation in the video below. This is <strong>Alexander Villena</strong>, like a lot of the people highlighted in these great inspirational videos was a fairly sporty person but wanted to be better. He wanted to push himself to be better and in his words he described himself as <em>"average"</em>. This is another great watch, I look at these videos when I have moments like last week when I'm not sure about myself or my progress. Bring on week five, time to step up the intensity again!</p><div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RUPe2OuE6pc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><h3>
