  <p>The year 2014 hosted, some argue, the world's greatest FIFA world cup in it's history in Brazil. So many twists and turns, shock and surprises! And the final was hosted in Rio De Janeiro to the finalists Argentina and Germany. Everyone will remember the big stories, the heroes and the villains. I've not the biggest football fan there is (my fiance <a href="https://twitter.com/Midget_Gem17" style="background-color: initial;">@Midget_Gem17</a> takes that crown). Apparently it was a good final with a great goal the seal it for Germany (spoiler alert).</p>

<p>The year 2014 hosted, some argue, the world's greatest FIFA world cup in it's history in Brazil. So many twists and turns, shock and surprises! And the final was hosted in Rio De Janeiro to the finalists Argentina and Germany. Everyone will remember the big stories, the heroes and the&nbsp;villains. I've not the biggest football fan there is (my fiance&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Midget_Gem17">@Midget_Gem17</a> takes that crown).&nbsp;Apparently&nbsp;it was a good final with a great goal the seal it for Germany (spoiler alert).</p><p>I didn't see the final, apart from the last ten minutes of extra time due to dedication. I had one session for Freeletics left in the week, I had already lost Monday and Friday due to Badminton training, I had also lost Saturday to a wonderful day out! Sunday was the last possible day... and then I lost the morning/afternoon to wedding planning (probably the best excuse).</p><p>I was tempted to pack up for the day, Iris not being one of my favourite workouts either, but you don't quit Freeletics! I've been there before when giving up on something and it isn't good, looking back after quitting on something is the worse, no more regrets. So I spent the next one hour and fifty minutes doing Freeletics outside in the cold while everyone else was inside watching the final. And you know what? No regrets :D</p><p><img style="-webkit-user-select: none; width: 342px;" src="http://cl.jroo.me/z3/g/X/A/e/a.baa-Happy-dog-.jpg"></p><h3>End of week nine figures:</h3><p><strong>Workout Times (hh:mm:ss):</strong></p><ul>
