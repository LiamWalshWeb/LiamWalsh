	Freeletics Cardio and Strength Coach, Week fourteen has come to an end! I can hardly believe how far I've come in the time I've been doing Freeletics but the penultimate week is upon us! This week's workouts were a good mix between long intense cardio and short explosive strength. This week very much feels like the spirit of Freeletics really.
</p>
<p>
	The workouts give a great all round fitness regime to build both stamina, speed and power. I love Poseidon because it's difficult but able to complete quickly with very little breaks in between, same goes for Metis. Iris is one of my least favourite just because of how long it takes me and how tiring it is, having said that it means that it works.
</p>
<p>
	All of these things are great but this week I didn't really feel any difference, no extra challenge, no surprise, just a good tough mix week. Like in&nbsp;
	<a href="/blog/week-eleven-winding-up">week eleven</a> it feels like the build up to next week, the final week, the hell week. I can only do my best this week and push myself to make sure that when next week comes I will be able to do the best I can. The final week deserves the best out of me.
</p>
<p>
	I also wanted to detail this week what i plan to do after the final fifteen week blog post. I don't plan to blog about Freeletics on a weekly basis anymore but will post bigger more informative posts now and then. These posts will be more centred around news relating to Freeletics, my progress after a longer period of time, basically covering a broader variety of subjects compared to these weekly blog posts.
</p>
<p>
	That's it for this week then, not much to say in this one so I'll see you on the other side of Freeletics Hell next week! :D
</p>
<p>
	<strong>UPDATE!</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Future blog posts will most likely be going up on a lovely website called&nbsp;
	<a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>! I'll be posting there in a collection I've been invited to by the lovely&nbsp;<a href="mailto:https://twitter.com/@imrane">Imran Esmail</a>! You can see the&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/a-freeletics-journey">collection here</a>.
