  	Coming off the back of last week's triumph with the toughest week yet, it was gonna feel different and rather normal going back to a more familiar Freeletics schedule. I wondered how this week might turn out having passed a big test, I was pleasantly surprised that week eight turned out to be another big turning point!</p>

	Coming off the back of last week's triumph with the toughest week yet, it was gonna feel different and rather normal going back to a more familiar Freeletics schedule. I wondered how this week might turn out having passed a big test, I was pleasantly surprised that week eight turned out to be another big turning point!
</p>
<p>
	After battling so long with Freeletics and having both ups and downs along the way week eight proved to be one of the most promising yet. I wanted to touch on something very important that I should have mentioned. Freeletics has set routines with specific workout exercises, having said that there are certain exercises such as pull-ups and handstand push-ups that people would struggle to do even one repetition of so there are star versions, which are the most difficult and&nbsp;modified versions of the exercise which are slightly easier making it possible for people to progress by completing a complete set of the exercise.
</p>
<p>
	Up until now I have down the modified version of pull-ups and handstand push-ups due to lack of upper body strength... until this week! I looked at this week and wanted to make another impact like week seven so I challenged myself to do as many star pull-ups on any routines that had them. I amazed at the results! In previous weeks I wasn't even able to do one pull-up! This week I was able to do more than half of the pull-ups in the routines as the star version! It felt amazing to be able to see this big step after such a challenging week.
</p>
<p>
	This for me was progress in a different way! Maybe not improving on my times this week but I am that step closer to pulling off more star versions! It's all about form before time with Freeletics and I'm following just that.

	Just wanted to share this song with you below as well, it's a great track to add to the workout playlist and is my favourite song of all time from my most favourite and influential band I've ever known. Well worth a listen.
