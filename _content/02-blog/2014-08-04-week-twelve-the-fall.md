<p>This week was a bit of a funny week, making it strangely difficult to write about from the off. Week number twelve of Freeletics is sadly the first week where I have failed somewhat in Freeletics. I'll go into more detail about the mishap later but first I'd like to talk about failure itself first.</p><p>I've read a lot about people's opinions on failure especially in the startup culture of the modern technological world. People seem to praise failure, state that failure is nothing to be ashamed of and that's true in some cases, in some cases what doesn't kill you makes you stronger I guess. Only through failure can we learn from our mistakes, if everything went perfectly in our endeavours then our experiences with dealing in situations becomes limited.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/batman-why-do-we-fall.jpg"></p><p>Alfred explains this ideology to a young Bruce Wayne in a perfectly summarised quote, <strong>"Why do we fall sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.</strong><strong>"</strong> This line is from Batman Begins a great movie but the message is so clear and simple from Alfred's perspective. When we fall we experience something different and we can never learn or begin to understand how to rise without first falling.</p><p>Going back to the modern startup culture&nbsp;mentality, some people preach about failure almost as if it's something to achieve, it should only serve as a lesson. People must understand that failing is not the end of the world but must also understand that it does not excuse not putting in every ounce of effort and ability to achieve success.</p><p>Freeletics trains you both physically and mentally to beat against the urge to give up, to quit, to <strong>"try again tomorrow"</strong>. There have been many a time where I've wanted to quit a session, to go back inside to the warmth of the house and snuggle up with some pizza or something. It's the hardest thing in the world to push yourself beyond your comfort zone, to fight the quiting feeling, to fight failure.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/bruce-lee-defeat.jpg" style="width: 500px;"></p><p>A great idol of mine (and of many people) is Bruce Lee, someone I feel was almost a modern philosopher. Many inspirational quotes from Bruce Lee but the one I'm reminded of is this, <strong>"defeat is a state of mind; no one is ever defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality"</strong>. I truly believe in this statement, the minute you cease to believe you can achieve something is the moment you lose the ability to achieve that thing.</p><p>So back to my experience of failure then.&nbsp;Week twelve on paper looked like a typical week in Freeletics, no big surprises but still challenging. A step down in the number of sessions from the previous week it actually looked like a "relaxed" week, if you even get those in Freeletics. I actually started off the week with a great personal best for Aphrodite! A staple routine for any Free Athlete! I felt really good.</p><p>My downfall came on the Sunday when my last session was planned, I had been at a family event from the Friday to the Sunday and only found opportunity for the last session of the week on Sunday after travelling back. The rest of the week had been filled up with more training and other events.&nbsp;So on Sunday night at about 9pm I began the Hades workout which I usually do in my back garden, but with the UK creeping ever closer to autumn the nights are closing in and I soon found myself training in the darkness. I gave up on the sprinting element of Hades for the fear of falling and twisting an ankle or worse.</p><p>I gave up, sadly. I didn't even look for an alternative for the sprinting, I just skipped it, finished the routine and cam back inside, also forgetting I hadn't done a max situp either. I felt pretty bad because for all the effort I've put into Freeletics so far I had succumb to comfort. I went back inside and funnily enough i actually had pizza! A bad diet move to top it all off.</p><p>Well I've learned my lesson from failure this week, I shall not postpone, I shall not falter and I will not fall again.</p><h3>End of week twelve figures:</h3><p><strong>Workout Times (hh:mm:ss):</strong></p><ul> <li>Wednesday - Aphrodite = 00:30:55</li><li>Thursday<ul><li>Hades = 00:46:21</li><li>Squat Max = 175</li></ul></li><li>Friday<ul><li>Burpee Max = 52</li><li>Burpee Max = 40</li><li>Burpee Max = 40</li></ul></li><li>Sunday<ul><li>Hades = 00:49:46</li><li>Situp Max = FAIL</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Weight:</strong></p><ul><li>Week Eleven = 79.8kg</li><li>Week Twelve = 79.5kg</li></ul>
