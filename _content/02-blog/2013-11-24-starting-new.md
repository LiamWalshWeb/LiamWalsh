  	     A fresh year, a fresh start, a fresh website! Welcome all to my new and improved website! This website is the start of a big push for me become the man I want to be. I've built this website from the ground up using <a href="http://statamic.com/">Statamic</a>, in my opinion the best CMS since sliced bread (was sliced bread ever a CMS?). This site is the first step in becoming more involved in the web community who has given so much to me already, I hope to repay in kind.

	       A few things I'd like to explain about the website so lets start with the most obvious addition, the <a href="/blog">blog</a>!
</p>
<p>
	      In a world now where everybody has a blog I hope to cover things that maybe other people may not, this blog is also a part of sharing my day to day knowledge that may help others. Writing about all things web along with posts on every day working life and improving in small ways.

	      The stranger addition to the website is the <a href="/humble-tributes">humble tributes</a> section. This will be the place where I design one page web tributes to things that I love and inspire me! For more information please jump <a href="/humble-tributes">over there for more</a>.
