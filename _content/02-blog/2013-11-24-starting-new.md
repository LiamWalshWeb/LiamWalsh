  	 A fresh year, a fresh start, a fresh website! Welcome all to my new and improved website! This website is the start of a big push for me become the man I want to be. I've built this website from the ground up using <a href="http://statamic.com/">Statamic</a>, in my opinion the best CMS since sliced bread (was sliced bread ever a CMS?). This site is the first step in becoming more involved in the web community who has given so much to me already, I hope to repay in kind.

	   A fresh year, a fresh start, a fresh website! Welcome all to my new and improved website! This website is the start of a big push for me become the man I want to be.

	   A few things I'd like to explain about the website so lets start with the most obvious addition, the <a href="/blog">blog</a>!
</p>
<p>
	  In a world now where everybody has a blog I hope to cover things that maybe other people may not, this blog is also a part of improving myself as a person and a professional on the web.
</p>
<p>
	   I hope you guys will follow along with my progress in "A Creation a Day" in which I will try and create something (no matter how large or small) a day for a whole year! I will try my absolute best to try and complete this challenge and turn this challenge into a habit.

	  The stranger addition to the website is the <a href="/humble-tributes">humble tributes</a> section. This will be the place where I design one page web tributes to things that I love and inspire me! For more information please jump <a href="/humble-tributes">over there for more</a>.

	   Welcome again guys to my new website and please feel free to comment either here or anywhere else you can find me. Let the journey begin...
