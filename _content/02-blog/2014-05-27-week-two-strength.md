	One week down and fourteen more to go, week two offered yet another challenge. The routines this week were focused a lot more on strength and building endurance for strength related exercises. Facing the obstacle of both pull-ups and push-ups in large repetitions they pushed me to the breaking point, I did feel like giving up on but didn't. I'm starting to see the appeal of Freeletics now, people write about it and mention it in their inspirational videos. I knew that the strength routines would be the most difficult for me but with the ethos of Freeletics kept me going when I wanted to quit, or when I felt I couldn't make it.</p><p>
	I didn't manage to do the star version of pull-ups opting instead for the negative pull-ups suggested on the app video. This didn't discourage me though, I knew that this would take time and I put one hundred percent into each of the workouts.</p><p>
	I also experienced working out in a new environment, at the moment I do all my workouts in my back garden but this weekend I was at Center Parcs and instead opted for using the gym as the workout space (having mats and water cooler already provided). I found that I struggled a little more compared to doing workouts outside, not having my own music and a different mat. I realised that varying the environment could both be a good thing and a bad thing, testing yourself even more through other variables but at the risk of disrupting the things that might help push yourself.</p><p>
	This week I wanted to highlight definitely one of my favourite workout songs, it's called 'Now' by Fireflight. The lyrics, the tempo, everything about the song inspires me, pushes me when I'm struggling. I highly recommend adding this to your workout playlist, it's a definite big hitter.</p>
