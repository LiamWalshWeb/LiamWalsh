	Another week and more challenges to face. I faced this third week with a bit of a troubled mind. I had noticed that from week one to week two that my weight had gone up! The inexperience and high expectations were the cause to my doubt this week, I look at the numbers and see the opposite of progress! My weight going up (not even by much really) caused me to doubt myself, was I doing something wrong? Not pushing myself? Too slow? Eating too much? Reading&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/weight-loss/weight-fluctuations-explained.html#b">this article</a> shortly after I should have known it was not a big deal.</p><p>
	This lead me to think about how I was approaching Freeletics, I was expecting immediate changes to happen which wasn't realistic. My own expectations not only of myself but of Freeletics almost jeopardised my own progress! Week three is not the time to start seeing it all come together, I realise that now, but this story is not uncommon and I recon it is why a lot of people stop, quit or give up on trying to improve. If people can't see progress then they'll look to something else. In a world where more of our lives are faster and more immediate than ever before people want the shortcuts, the quick wins, they want the inside secret. But there is none, just like there always has been, to create something great you&nbsp;need time.</p><p>
	So don't set your expectations too high, give things time,&nbsp;not just Freeletics but in all things,&nbsp;and make sure you're 100% committed! It's the only way to achieve greatness in anything. It's like they say, <strong>great things come to those who wait</strong>.</p>
