	Having got through the second third of the Freeletics journey I thought this weeks post it would be good to talk about how it's been so far. There's a lot to be said about what you can achieve in ten weeks. Some of my personal milestones include being able to do a full pull up,&nbsp;taking the belt in a notch and generally feeling much better when I get up and go to work.</p><p>
	It's easy to forget sometimes where you started when you still haven't reached your destination. I haven't reached the goal I set out for but there is still plenty of weeks to go and if I don't reach where I want to be in that time I can review, reassess and carry on. I had a pause this week when writing this post to have a look at where I started out from and realised that I've come along way! I see the change in me, my attitude, my mood and one very significant change is that I feel hungry for victory again.</p><p>
	I'm a big badminton and have played for many years but having hit college and university meant that it had to take a back seat then so I could focus on important life moments. Before then I used to play a lot of competitive badminton and was always dreamed of becoming a pro (sadly not) and during those later years I lost my hunger to compete because my standard dropped, it felt&nbsp;very demotivating.&nbsp;Freeletics has given me a new edge in my competitive game again&nbsp;and for the first time in years I'm going to be entering a highly competitive competition in December to see if I still got the moves :D</p><p>Freeletics so far has been great! I had some ups and downs along the way, I found it both challenging mentally and physically but it's been so worth it! I would recommend Freeletics to anybody in a heartbeat. The best bit is that the journey isn't over yet and there are still many challenges to face.</p><p>Last thing this week is another track for the workout playlist, a new band that I discovered with a great first album that's well worth buying. Some of there tracks instantly jumped up to the top of my favourite songs for workouts and general listening. The band is called&nbsp;
