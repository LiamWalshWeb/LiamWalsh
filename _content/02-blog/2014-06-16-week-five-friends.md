<p>This week wasn't the best of weeks really. We all have a bad day at work, or find ourselves too busy to do much. This week was one of them, a number of evening events meant that two workout sessions had to be squeezed to together on a very hot Sunday afternoon in Manchester. Having a gap a three days didn't help performance going back to the workouts.</p><p>Enough of the bad now though and on to something new! This week I was&nbsp;grateful&nbsp;to be joined by a <strong>new Free Athlete</strong><strong>!</strong> Check out this little rascal below!</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/gemma-rascal-20140618213251.jpg" style="width: 449px;"></p><p>Yeah... got the bear claws out!&nbsp;Her name is <strong>Gemma Lamb</strong>, please feel free to follow her on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Midget_Gem17">@Midget_Gem17</a>. She's a hilarious and cute individual bear and is in fact my&nbsp;fianc√©! I've known her for years and when I told her about starting Freeletics and what I wanted to achieve, she has been the one who has pushed me and made me feel like I can do it even when I don't! I can't stress enough that this week I've realised what a difference it makes having someone by your side when working out. Freeletics is a sport and like all the best sports they are competitive on both an individual level and a team level. She began her Freeletics journey this week and started well before, sadly, pulling her calf. She's not giving up now though she wants to rest up and attack the Freeletics journey too when her injury has eased up.</p><p>Gemma had only done sports very early in her life and compared to recent years hasn't been involved in any at all! Passing university and getting a full time job means you end up sitting at a desk for most of your day, a very common story. She and I have chosen to not sit back and get&nbsp;comfortable&nbsp;but to get off the couch when we get home and get fit, push ourselves.</p><p>I'll say this to all of the people who are newbies or veterans, fit or unfit that there is always time to change but in the immortal words of Sean Bean and George R.R Martin I say this, <em>"Brace yourself, summer is coming!!!"</em></p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/brace-yourself-summer.jpg"></p><h3>End of week five figures:</h3><p><strong>Workout Times (hh:mm:ss):</strong></p><ul> <li>Monday - Hades = 00:50:29</li><li>Tuesday - Artemis = 01:05:30</li><li>Saturday - Hades = 01:03:19</li><li>Sunday - Iris = 02:02:00</li><li>Sunday<ul><li>Situp Max = 87</li><li>Burpee Max = 30</li><li>Situp Max = 70</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Weight:</strong></p><ul> <li>Week Four = 82.3kg</li><li>Week Five = 81.6kg</li></ul>
