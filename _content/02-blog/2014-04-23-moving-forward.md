  	One of the hardest things to do in life is to move on, to move away from the comfortable, the norm, the familiar. To progress in life, life requires you to move forward whether that be at work, in your personal life or in some other aspect. I, like many others, find it hard to move forward in life for fear of insecurity or failure or simply out of loyalty.

	For most of my life I have challenged myself in too few areas to have truly moved forward as much as I would have liked compared to other aspects. For example I have always found it easier to move forward in education because you are forced to move onto high school, college and then for some university. Places where I have found it harder to move forward are in my sporting life whether it was not wanting to leave one coach for another or moving to a new team.

	This year for me was a about starting again, about not being afraid to move forward, to be happy again in all aspects of my life. Making steps forward in places where I was comfortable to hopefully help me become a better professional and person all around. This started with a <a href="/blog/starting-new">fresh website</a>, and then at the end of March I was lucky enough to join <a href="http://www.accessadvertising.co.uk/">Access Advertising</a>! Being more active on social platforms to share great web stuff.

	This blog post is mostly a personal one but I'd like to ask you this, have you moved forward? Perhaps you also suffer from the pains I have? Perhaps you've dealt with different situations and want to share you're experience? Please feel free to leave a comment.
