title: 'Week One - Burpees'

excerpt: "<p>Burpees... burpees... that one word alone sums up this week. If you google people's experience's with doing high repetition burpees they tend to end with a few tears. They test strength and endurance, the Aphrodite workout has 150 of them in total. After day one I was tried and tested, I managed to complete the stared workout with a good time but even better with good form. Second time around I improved dramatically with the experience of the first day to pace myself better. The third workout I managed to lose a bit of time. Highs and lows are what comes with every experience in life, so no difference here.</p>"
