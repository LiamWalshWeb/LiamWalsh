excerpt: "<p>Burpees... burpees... that one word alone sums up this week. If you google people's experience's with doing high repetition burpees they tend to end with a few tears. They test strength and endurance, the Aphrodite workout has 150 of them in total. After day one I was tried and tested, I managed to complete the stared workout with a good time but even better with good form. Second time around I improved dramatically with the experience of the first day to pace myself better. The third workout I managed to lose a bit of time. Highs and lows are what comes with every experience in life, so no difference here.</p>"

<p>Burpees... burpees... that one word alone sums up this week. If you google people's experience's with doing high repetition burpees they tend to end with a few tears. They test strength and endurance, the Aphrodite workout has 150 of them in total. After day one I was tried and tested, I managed to complete the stared workout with a good time but even better with good form. Second time around I improved dramatically with the experience of the first day to pace myself better. The third workout I managed to lose a bit of time. Highs and lows are what comes with every experience in life, so no difference here.</p><p>There was a point in each of the workouts this week where I felt that I might not be able to finish or wanting to pack up for the night and go get some tea, but I didn't give in. My mind was tested along with my body and I managed to come out on top of this first week. Time is the cost of achieving something great and I'm still very early on my journey to feeling better, the workouts will only get tougher, perhaps longer too. It's one week down and fourteen to go, so bring on the burpees!</p><h3>End of week one figures:</h3><p><strong>Workout Times (hh:mm:ss):</strong></p><ul> <li>Monday - Aphrodite = 01:01:06 </li><li>Wednesday - Aphrodite = 00:47:49 </li><li>Saturday - Aphrodite = 00:55:32</li></ul><p><strong>Weight:</strong></p><ul> <li>Week Zero = 84.6kg</li><li>Week One = 85kg</li></ul>
