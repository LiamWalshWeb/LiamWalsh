<p>Picking up the pieces from last week's disappointment I find myself drawing nearer to the end of my journey with Freeletics at week Thirteen. I'm incredibly proud to have reached this far with Freeletics and have been astonished by the results I have seen so far. But I'm still not there yet and want more with every session that goes by.</p><p>One of the hardest things with Freeletics, that has reared it's ugly head this week again, is finding the motivation to carry on. It's hard to pull yourself out of the house and into the rain, or snow (not had to deal with that yet) when inside your house you can be nice and warm and have some hot food. Not for the Free Athlete I'm afraid, if you want that you need to work first.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/freeltics-rain.jpg"></p><p>Freeletics often hits you full in the face with a big wall of workouts and the feeling of dread meets everyone sometimes during their Freeletics life. Finding excuses can be easy when your environment changes or when life inevitably gets a bit busy.</p><p>Everyone must find their own inspiration and motivation to deal with these times. It can be anything from listening to some upbeat music, re-watching one of the many amazing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=freeletics">Freeletics inspirational videos</a>! For me I either re-watch one of the videos or I look in the mirror real hard and try to see the me I want to become and if none of those work I look towards my beautiful&nbsp;fianc√© and I remember the man I need to become for her.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/freeletics-snowing.jpg" style="width: 501px;"></p><p>Our original motives should always be the strongest though, so for me I wanted to both look better physically and become a better badminton athlete, to reach the next level and be proud of myself again by training to achieve more!</p><p>So if your struggling through, or finding yourself getting too comfortable again just look again before quitting and ask yourself why you want to do this. the right motivation will always overcome the urge to give in. So go and watch an epic movie or reassess your goals and you will find the motivation you need to carry on.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/300-never-give-up.jpg"></p><p>I wanted to link to some music again this week but this time I've gone for a different genre of music for inspiration.&nbsp;<a href="http://brickwallaudio.com/">Brickwall Audio</a> produce music that has been used in many types of media including tv shows, movies and so on. This type of music has some of the best upbeat and blood pumping tunes I've heard in a long time. There are no lyrics to the music, there is just the epic score to shine through. One of my favourites has to be "Lord of Dragons" which can be found through their&nbsp;<a href="http://brickwallaudio.com/">website</a> or on&nbsp;<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/114590249/playlist/7iYFC0HstNNiK5eSp1CJ2G">spotify</a>.</p><h3>End of week thirteen figures:</h3><p><strong>Workout Times (hh:mm:ss):</strong></p><ul>
