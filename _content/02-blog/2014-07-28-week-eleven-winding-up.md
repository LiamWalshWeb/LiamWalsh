<p>Into the last third of Freeletics and I already feel great! It does start to feel like the workouts are going up another gear in preparation to the final week, week fifteen, the hell week! The session are getting bigger, longer, with more strength exercises and the sessions are bumped up to a minimum of four times a week.</p><p>This week was a tough one, following on from last week by upping the amount of strength training and I was beginning to feel more confident in pull ups and push ups! The staple diet of burpees was also on the menu this week and I feel like I'm getting stronger and can endure more burpees in succession.</p><p>Nothing really incredible happened this week, it was tough with having a lot of badminton training as well but I did feel good for getting some good max results for pull ups. Those number might not seem a lot to some but for me that is big progress.</p><p>This all feels great but it feels like preparation for something bigger, there is still a way to go before the end but&nbsp;week fifteen here I come!</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/4_Freeletics_pushups.jpg" style="width: 644px;"></p><h3>End of week eleven figures:</h3><p><strong>Workout Times (hh:mm:ss):</strong></p><ul>
