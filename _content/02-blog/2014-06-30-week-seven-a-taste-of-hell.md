Week seven presents a new, greater, more fearsome challenge. Week seven changes the pace of Freeletics by facing the challenger with three so called "Hell Days". Hell days are three workouts in one day, they do not need to be completed in one session or two but all must be done in one day.</p>'

<p>There are times in life when we choose to challenge ourselves and Freeletics is one of those challenges but week seven is by far the biggest challenge Freeletics presents any free athlete. Week seven presents a new, greater, more fearsome challenge. Week seven changes the pace of Freeletics by facing the challenger with three so called "Hell Days". Hell days are three workouts in one day, they do not need to be completed in one session or two but all must be done in one day.</p><p>I faced week seven with mixed feelings, I felt anxious and confident at the same time, I knew the gauntlet and what it would take to defeat it. I'm reminded of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy">The Divine Comedy</a> in times of suffering and trial, one of the greatest literatures ever written about a man's journey through Hell, Purgatory and finally unto Paradise.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/content/dante.jpg"></p><p>I found it quite fitting that this week presents three days of three workouts each day, equalling nine workouts in total, the same number as the number of circles in the Inferno as described by Dante. Each circle presents its own sin and its own challenges Dante must overcome, not too different to the workouts of Freeletics. Each workout has it's own challenge, it's identity, it's purpose and they each test us in their own specific way. I find pull-ups and burpees particularly difficult compared to other exercises, I also find it harder and longer to complete Iris compared to any other workout due to climbers.</p><blockquote>Abandon hope all ye who enter here</blockquote><p>This message is written upon the gates of hell in the Inferno. And this is the place I find myself after this week. It feels like my journey with Freeletics has changed me a lot and now I find myself with even more challenges awaiting me. Tougher, longer, more tiring workouts to come.</p><p><img src="http://liamwalsh/assets/blog/content/gates-of-hell.jpg" style="font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; width: 527px;"></p><p>This message is not solely in the spirit of Freeletics but in the spirit of living. Dante travelled a long way through treacherous paths that no other living man had tread, he did not let fear take over the completing of the challenge though, passing the tests and completing the journey lead him to Paradise. Completing the rest of the Freeletics guide will not be easy, but nothing worth doing in life is easy and at least I know now that I can tackle any hurdle Freeletics throws at me.</p><h3>End of week seven figures:</h3><p><strong>Workout Times (hh:mm:ss):</strong></p><ul> <li>Monday
